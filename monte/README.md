## Monte-Carlo Tree Search for Tic-Tac-Toe  
MCTS is a popular planning algorithm which was widely used in Game AI.
Vanilla MCTS randomly picks an action when building search tree. UCT instead uses an algorithm that can trade-off exploration and exploitation. For more details about UCT, refer [MCTS survey](http://pubs.doc.ic.ac.uk/survey-mcts-methods/survey-mcts-methods.pdf).   Â 

## Tic-Tac-Toe
Here we use UCT1 to play an variation of classic Tic-Tac-Toe called 'Ultimate Tic-Tac-Toe'.   
See [this post]( http://mathwithbaddrawings.com/2013/06/16/ultimate-tic-tac-toe/ ) for details about the game.  
The implementations of the game borrows from [this repo](https://github.com/jbradberry/ultimate_tictactoe).
